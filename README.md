# RIDE'M
RIDE’M is a rhythm + runner game based on electronic dance music (EDM) culture.

Think Temple Run or Subway Surfers—but add a beat. RIDE’M is a combo rhythm-runner game for mobile platforms, where players are an aspiring DJ, playing “shows” by swiping left, right, up, and down and riding to the rhythm, collecting beats, dropping beats, and avoiding off beats. They’ll play “shows” to gain rep and get invited to "festivals" through a fast-paced musical experience with a familiar gameplay mechanics.
