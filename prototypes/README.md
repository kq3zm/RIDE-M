# Lab 6 - Physical Prototypes
Josie Chiao, Jonathan Bentley, Katherine Qian

## Prototype Description
There are two pictures for our physical prototype:
1. `prototype1.jpg`
2. `prototype2 (drop beat).jpg`

This is a physical prototype of our "Show Mode" (see design doc). At the bottom, it shows three placeholders for which the player can swipe left and right to be in the correct column. Our physical prototype had a long sheet of beats glued to it that could be pulled down to create a "scrolling" effect.

The three beat types (regular, drop, off) were represented by red star, large green star, and black square, respectively.

In `prototype1.jpg`, we show the player in the right column to collect the regular beat in the right column and avoid the off beat in the center column.

At the top of the screen, there is a number displayed that is the "rep" players collect as they collect beats (and correctly avoid off beats). On the right, there is the CO2 meter that players generate once they've reached full multiplier—there is a slider on the meter that displays and indicates the current multiplier the player is at. In the background, you can see the crowd—this is how the "crowd hype" is displayed, and if the player is doing a good job they will see that there are more people in the crowd. If the player misses beats or accidentally catches off beats, they will see that people leave the crowd.

There is also a pause button in the bottom left corner that would bring players to the "Show Pause" mode (see design doc).

In `prototype2.jpg`, all the above is the same, except that we show we have the large green star that represents a "drop beat". Players here would not only be expected to be in the same column (as pictured) but would also be expected to swipe down upon collision.
